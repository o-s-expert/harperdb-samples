== Overview

This repository contains multiple Java projects that demonstrate how to integrate HarperDB with different Java frameworks, including Quarkus, Micronaut, and Spring. You can choose to use the cloud-based HarperDB solution at link:https://studio.harperdb.io/sign-up[HarperDB Cloud] or run it locally using Docker.

To run HarperDB locally with Docker, execute the following command:

[source,bash]
----
docker run -d \
  -e HDB_ADMIN_USERNAME=root \
  -e HDB_ADMIN_PASSWORD=password \
  -e HTTP_THREADS=4 \
  -p 9925:9925 \
  -p 9926:9926 \
  harperdb/harperdb
----

== Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the projects:

1. **Install Maven:** If you don't have Maven installed, you can download it from link:https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi[Maven Apache] and follow the installation instructions.

2. **Clone the Repository:**

[source,bash]
----
git clone <repository_url>
cd harperdb-samples
----

3. **Choose a Project:**

- Navigate to the subdirectories (e.g., `quarkus-project`, `micronaut-project`, `spring-project`) for the Java framework you want to explore.

4. **Configure HarperDB:**

- If you are using HarperDB Cloud, sign up for an account at link:https://studio.harperdb.io/sign-up[HarperDB Cloud] and obtain your API credentials.
- If you are running HarperDB locally with Docker, ensure Docker is running with the provided configuration.

5. **Update Configuration:**

- Open the relevant configuration files in the selected Java project (e.g., `application.properties`, `harperdb.properties`) and configure your HarperDB connection details.

6. **Build and Run:**

[source,bash]
----
# For each Java project (e.g., quarkus-project, micronaut-project, spring-project)
cd quarkus-project
mvn clean install
mvn quarkus:dev
----

7. **Access the Applications:** Open your web browser and navigate to the respective application endpoints to interact with each Java project.
